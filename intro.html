                  <p> The year is 2018. Central and South America are at a crossroads.  
                      After generations of ecenomic exploitation at the hands of 
                      European colonizers proud nations now chart their own course.
                      However, power vacuums created by dictatorships and failed socialist states have given rise to drug cartels, 
                      fueled by the prohibition and insatiable drug lust of USA.  As money fows into the coffers of the cartels, violence explodes on the streets.
                      Rather than stay and raise their children under the boots of Drug Lords, many citizens have packed what little they can and fled north, with hopes of America and a better way of life.
                      However, in the year 2016 the united states government elected as it's president a game 
                      show host who saw anyone not of Anglo-Saxon descent to be subhuman and inferior. Under his rule  Lady Liberty, from her beacon hand, has dimmed the light of world-wide welcome.
                      No longer does she your poor, your tired, your huddled masses yearning to be free accept.  The nation has shut its doors to migrants, and those who are caught crossing the border are imprissoned
                      without trial, their children ripped from their arms.  

                      Yet in this land their is still hope.  Bastions of understanding and compassion, places of diversity and tolerance, hold true to the words laid down by the poet Lazarus so many generaitons ago.  Sanctuary citites they are called,
                      stand with open arms and promises of protections for anyone who should make the trek to them.  And through this great land, there is a secret trail.  A road paved by those who have made the journey, secret and reliable,
                      inspired by those brave settlers who once made the journey west across this great land to places like, oh - lets say Oregon -.  This secret road is long, and its trail rocky.  The going will be slow, but it is the safer route.  This road
                      is not without its perils, but you have the power to manage them.  This road stands ready for you and your family. 

                      You have $1000.

                      You have an old RV.

                      You have a the trail.
